---- WEEK 02/13 ----

...... TUE | 10/01 ......

		: 6:14 am cst
		All folders are only 1 deep.
		Made a new branch called 'nuketown' - about to merge it.

		: 5:01 am cst
		I spent most of yesterday refactoring and working on this repo. 
		I completely nuked the easy/ folder I had in an effort to start over and that's when I realized I was becoming super frustrated.
		I have been refactoring for almost a week and I haven't started on any leetcode bc my environment wasn't set up.
		I was so focused on making the repo simple so it could scale.
		I called it a night, relaxed, watched a movie (KPop Demon Hunters), and then showered when I realized: I was trying to create an exact COPY of something that already existed. 
		The plan is to nuke the repo and only have it be one layer deep.
		All will be understood when I'm done.
		And then I'm going to sleep.
		Goodnight!

...... TUE | 09/30 ......

		: 4:22 pm cst
		Finally at my computer. 
		Changed the characters for the formatting after all. 
		Going to devise a legend maybe, but I still way a lot of formatting to do with what already exists before I can start doing problems. 
		I want to get my system down nice and easy first. 
		
		: 2:30 pm cst
		First entry. 
		Typing and formatting on my phone (THANK GOD FOR WORD WRAP) with Github Mobile. 
		Not the biggest fan of the characters I'm using for separators so far but they are just placeholders for the time being. 
		Battery @ 7%. 
		Made this repo a long time ago and just threw (trash) together. 
		Been reformatting a lot. 
		Something clean, easy, and scalable. 
		There's only 3,700 problems total and I found another site for ML Leetode (deep-ml.com) questions that I won't even think about doing until wayyy after this has been conquered. 
		Got 100 problems to do before 2025 is up. 
		Then it's Leet Year 2026, 10 problems/day for the other remaining 3,600. 
		Let's do this thing.
