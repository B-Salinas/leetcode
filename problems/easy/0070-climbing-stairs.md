- `1 <= n <= 45`

### Examples

##### Example 1
> Input: `n = 2`   
> Output: `2`    
> Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
> 1. 1 step + 1 step
> 2. 2 steps

##### Example 2
> Input: `n = 3`    
> Output: `3`    
> Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
> 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
> 2. 1 step + 2 steps
