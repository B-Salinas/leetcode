			TUE, 09/30
			First entry. Typing and formatting on my phone (THANK GOD FOR WORD WRAP) with Github Mobile. Not the biggest fan of the characters I'm using for separators so far but they are just placeholders for the time being. Battery @ 7%.
			Made this repo a long time ago and just threw (trash) together. Been reformatting a lot. Something clean, easy, and scalable. There's only 3,700 problems total and I found another site for ML Leetode (deep-ml.com) questions that I won't even think about doing until wayyy after this has been conquered. 
			Got 100 problems to do before 2025 is up. Then it's Leet Year 2026, 10 problems/day for the other remaining 3,600.
			Let's do this thing.
